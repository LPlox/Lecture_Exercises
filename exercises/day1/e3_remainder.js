/**
 * Remainder
 * FINDING A REMAINDER IN JAVASCRIPT
 * The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
 *
 * Example
 * 5 % 2 = 1 because
 * Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
 * 2 * 2 = 4
 * 5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
 *
 * Usage
 * In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the
 * division of the number by 2.
 * 17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
 * 48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
 *
 * Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
 *
 * TASK
 * Write 3 remainder calculations where the result is determined.
