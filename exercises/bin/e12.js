 * 94 ACCESSING NESTED ARRAYS
 * As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects
 * and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation
 * can be chained to access nested arrays.
 *
 *
 * Tasks
 * Using dot and bracket notation, set the variable secondTree to the second
 * item in the trees list from the myPlants object.
